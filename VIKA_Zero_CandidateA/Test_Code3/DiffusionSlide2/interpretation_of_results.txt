Note: A change in 1 bit of the plaintext produces a very small change in the resulting ciphertext with diffusion slide alone.
This makes sense, as the 1 bit is only moving along up to 16 bytes as it goes across with the XORs.

As for the differences between plaintexts and ciphertexts:

Diffusion Slide:

Highest Difference:	82/128
Lowest Difference:	33/128
Range:	49
Average Difference:	55.9965/128

Diffusion Slide 2:

Highest Difference:	91/128
Lowest Difference:	36/128
Range:	55
Average Difference:	63.9869/128


It makes sense that the DS1 has a smaller range due to it not covering the last byte of the block.
Also, DS1 is close to an average of 56 bits, also due to it not changing the last byte.
Finally, DS2 has an average close to half of the bits.
