# VIKA_Zero


VIKA_Zero: Vanishing Illusion Key Automator Zero
I chose the name VIKA many years ago when I coded my first few encryption systems, and wow, they were
absolutely horrible. As such, I'm calling this one VIKA Zero to show that the final version will be far
superior to those old ones, which is why it's 'Zero' instead of some higher number (The inspiration for this 
comes from Google's Go playing bots, AlphaGo and AlphaZero).


I'm putting this project up on here as an extra backup for now, though it is definitely far from complete.
While the "Candidate A" version I'm putting on here does all work, Candidate A is only the tip of the iceberg.


I finished at community college to earn my Associate's Degree in Computer Science, though there is still
so much for me to learn on my path of becoming a professional cryptologist. The three important subjects that come to
mind are Abstract Algebra, Number Theory, and Statistics. This Candidate A system will serve as a base for me
to work off of, and so I will create more candidates as I learn more of what I need. Once I've learned everything
needed and can deeply analyze this system myself, I can finalize this project by choosing one of the candidate systems
to become VIKA_Zero.


Also, as soon as I organize my files and write a very informal paper on Candidate A, I will put all that up on here
as well. (Message from 02-13-2025)


That's all for now,
