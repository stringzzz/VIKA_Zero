For this test, 4,608,000 keys were generated, the key schedule was produced for each one, and the S-Box and P-Box were
set up for each one. Then, every possible input was fed into each S-Box and P-Box, and the frequencies of the input/output
pairs were recorded in order to try and determine if there was some kind of bias for pairs that occured more frequently.

P-Box: Highest - Lowest = 145391 - 142868 = 2523
S-Box: Highest - Lowest = 18595 - 17448 = 1147

They appear to be fairly evenly distributed. The differences between them may be only by chance rather than
them showing any kind of bias. It is unclear as to exactly how much of the key goes into each box setup,
but it is safe to say that 2^12 * 1125 (# of box setups in test) is only a very small fraction of how many possible box setups there are.
Technically there are 256! (factorial) possible S-Boxes and 32! (factorial) possible P-Boxes, however due to the dependency on the key
to produce the box setups there are less possible setups than that, at most 2^128.

This really poses a problem for cryptanalyzing VIKA Zero. If the security of the cipher depends solely on
the secrecy of the key, and the box setups are determined only by the key, AND the possible setups of the boxes
are evenly distributed, how can one know which box setups are being used at any given time? Currently, I still
lack the skills needed to do proper cryptanalysis as it is, but this seems like a big obstacle in the analysis.
While this does sound great for the security of the cipher, I still definitely won't claim that the cipher
actually is secure, it is just more likely that I don't know how to approach any attacks on it in my ignorance,
so I will just leave it at that for now.
