Upon viewing the initial test results, I had mistakenly thought that the highly common pair of differentials
0->0 was significant. However, it is obvious that if the pair of input had matching bytes, then clearly the
pair of output must have matching bytes as well, making their differential also be 0. Taking the number of test box setups, 
3,500,000, and multiplying by the max number of occurences of the 0->0 pair, 256, we get 896,000,000, which is 
the exact number of occurences for all the box setups for that pair of differentials. Looking at the least common 
cases, it also makes sense that if the input differential is 0, then the output differential cannot be non-zero, 
and also if the input differential is non-zero, the output differential cannot be 0, which is why those differentials don't
occur at all.

Aside from that, the distribution of input and output differential pairs seems to be evenly distributed. Given that the
results of the previous test showed that the input byte -> output byte distribution also appears fairly even, it seems that
if there actually is some kind of bias then it must be subtle. I still clearly don't have what I need to even perform any
modern cryptanalysis attacks, and so it's safe to say that this test is inconclusive as to whether or not VIKA Zero is weak
against differential cryptanalysis or not, or at least my interpretation of these results is inconclusive.
