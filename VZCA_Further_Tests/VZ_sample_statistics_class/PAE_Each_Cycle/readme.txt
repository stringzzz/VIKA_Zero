This was for testing the bit differences between original plaintexts and their corresponding "bit flipped" plaintexts.
The differences were gathered at the end of each encryption cycle to track these differences as it goes through the entire encryption
process.

See "PAE_Each_Cycle_Test_Results1.pdf" in this directory for a mini informal paper on this test.
